Hey there! I'm Jaimin Bariya 👨‍💻 from Vadodara, Gujarat, India. I'm doing my MCA-AI at Parul University, one of the top universities in India 🎓. I love exploring new tech, learning new things, and solving problems.

I enjoy **problem-solving** and **first-principle thinking**. I'm driven by purpose and enjoy the challenge of finding solutions. I have a strong background in **Python, Javascript, Django, Flask, and React.js**. Me and my team have made projects on **Frontend, Backend, Machine Learning**, and building scalable products from scratch. My goal is to make a positive impact through technology.

Feel free to connect with me @jaimin-bariya for anything tech-related or just to say hello! Let's shape the future of tech together. 🌟
